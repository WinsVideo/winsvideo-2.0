# WinsVideo 2.0 Main Repository
The actual WinsVideo 2.0 Project

## Information
The project is moving from PHP to node.js and back to PHP. Want to know why? Please read this blog: https://winsdominoes.winscloud.net

## About
This is the WinsVideo 2.0 project. Me and some of my friends have decided that we are moving back to PHP because of it's reliability and other reasons such as simplicity.

### Goal
The goal of WinsVideo 2.0 are the following:
- Simple
- Secure

I (Win) think that the platform should be very simple to use and does not give the user a bad UX or sending unnessesary information infront of the homepage, and we would also have a poll whether if we should add a specific feature or remove a specific feature. 

### Contribution
WinsVideo 2.0 is open-source and will be continue to be open-source for years to come. YOU, yes YOU can contribute to the site if you have have knowledge on how to add a feature or any security stuff. So I hope that it will be a good thing. 

### Updates
You can follow the updates at my blog https://winsdominoes.winscloud.net (a new design will be made, believe me.)
